Line Follower Robot with Motor Driver and IR Sensors
This project is a simple yet effective line follower robot using an Arduino, two digital IR sensors, and a motor driver (L298N or L293D) to control two DC motors. The robot is designed to follow a black line on a white surface by reading sensor inputs and adjusting motor behavior accordingly.

Hardware Requirements
Components
Arduino Uno or compatible microcontroller

2 × DC Motors (Left & Right)

1 × Motor Driver Module (L298N or L293D)

2 × Digital IR Sensors (TCRT5000 or similar)

Power Supply (Battery pack or USB)

Chassis, Wheels, Jumper Wires
Pin Connections
Motor Driver
Arduino Pin	Motor Driver Pin	Description
10	ENA	Left Motor Speed (PWM)
11	ENB	Right Motor Speed (PWM)
5	IN1	Left Motor Direction Control 1
6	IN2	Left Motor Direction Control 2
7	IN3	Right Motor Direction Control 1
8	IN4	Right Motor Direction Control 2

IR Sensors (Digital Output)
Arduino Pin	Description
3	Left IR Sensor
4	Right IR Sensor

Speed Settings
Variable	Value	Description
baseSpeed	65	Normal forward speed (PWM)
reverseSpeed	60	Speed used during reversing
maxSpeed	90	Defined but not used (for future logic)

Working Logic
Both sensors LOW → Robot moves forward

Left HIGH, Right LOW → Robot turns left

Left LOW, Right HIGH → Robot turns right

Both HIGH → Robot moves backward to relocate the line

This logic helps the robot continuously adjust its path to follow the black line.

Control Functions (Arduino Sketch)
cpp
Copy
Edit
void moveForward(int speed);   // Runs both motors forward at given speed
void turnLeft(int speed);      // Stops left motor, runs right motor forward
void turnRight(int speed);     // Runs left motor, stops right motor
void moveBackward(int speed);  // Runs both motors in reverse
These functions are called inside the loop based on sensor readings.

Usage Instructions
Connect motors and IR sensors to the Arduino according to the pinout.

Upload the Arduino sketch (LineFollower.ino) to your microcontroller.

Power the robot and place it on a black line on a white background.

The robot will automatically begin following the line.
