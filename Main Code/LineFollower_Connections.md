# Line Follower Robot with Obstacle and Color Detection

This robot uses IR sensors to follow a line, an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles, and a TCS3200 color sensor to detect colored zones (red, green, blue). If the color sensor is not connected, the robot will still function using IR and ultrasonic sensors.

## üîã Power Supply

- **Motors** should be powered using an external 6‚Äì12V battery (e.g., Li-Po).
- **Arduino UNO** can be powered via USB or VIN pin from the same battery.
- **IR, Ultrasonic, and Color Sensors** use 5V from the Arduino.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your motor driver or motor control circuit can handle the motor current load safely.

## üß† Behavior Summary

| Sensor Triggered    | Robot Action              |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Both IR on black    | Moves forward             |
| One IR off line     | Turns to correct position |
| Obstacle detected   | Avoids by turning         |
| Red color detected  | Stops temporarily         |
| Green color detected| Boosts forward            |
| Blue color detected | Turns right               |
| No color            | Ignores and continues     |

## ‚úÖ Notes

- If the color sensor is not connected or returns noisy readings, the robot ignores it.
- We can customize actions for each color in the code.
- SEE `Serial Monitor` (9600 baud) to view sensor readings and debug.
