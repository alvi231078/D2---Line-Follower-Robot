# Intelligent Line Follower & Obstacle Avoidance Robot

This robot combines IR-based line following, ultrasonic obstacle detection, and optional color detection using the TCS3200 color sensor. It is designed to continue operating even if the color sensor is not connected or active.

## üîã Power Supply

- Motors must be powered with an external **6‚Äì12V battery** (Li-Po recommended).
- Arduino UNO can be powered via USB or from the **VIN pin** using the same battery.
- IR, ultrasonic, and color sensors operate on **5V from the Arduino**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure your motor driver can handle the current load of your motors.

## üß† Behavior Summary

| Trigger Condition        | Robot Response                 |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Both IR sensors on black | Move forward                  |
| One IR sensor off line   | Adjust direction              |
| Both IR sensors on white | Line lost ‚Üí Begin recovery    |
| Obstacle within 30 cm    | Avoid by turning and bypassing|
| Red color detected       | Stop temporarily              |
| Green color detected     | Move forward faster           |
| Blue color detected      | Turn right                    |
| No/Unknown color         | Ignore, continue normal logic |

## ‚úÖ Notes

- The robot gracefully handles **missing or noisy color sensor input** by ignoring it.
- Behavior for colors can be **easily customized** in the Arduino code.
- Use the **Serial Monitor (9600 baud)** to view real-time sensor readings for debugging.
