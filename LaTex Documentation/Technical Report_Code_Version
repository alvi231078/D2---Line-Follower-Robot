	\begin{abstract}
		This paper presents the design, development, and implementation of an Arduino-based robot capable of following a black line and avoiding obstacles in its path. The system integrates IR sensors for line detection and an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor for environmental scanning. The robot’s decision-making algorithm enables smooth path-following while dynamically reacting to obstacles. Both hardware and software components were prototyped virtually before real-world testing. Results show reliable performance in various test scenarios.

	\section{Introduction}
	Line-following and obstacle-avoiding robots are fundamental projects in the field of robotics and embedded systems. These robots offer practical insights into sensor integration, motor control, decision-making algorithms, and real-time behavior. Such applications are widely used in industrial automation, delivery robots, and warehouse management systems.
	
	This project focuses on the design and development of a mobile robot that can autonomously follow a predefined path while detecting and avoiding obstacles using infrared (IR) and ultrasonic sensors. The integration of hardware and software components was achieved through iterative prototyping, simulation (using Tinkercad), and formal verification using UPPAAL to ensure time-critical responsiveness.
	
	The objective was to create a low-cost, Arduino-based robot capable of smart navigation in dynamic environments, with collaborative development managed via Git and GitHub.

		\caption{Assembled Robot Car Design}
		\label{fig:assembled_car}
	\end{figure}
	
	The fully assembled robot car was modeled and visualized in SolidWorks 3D CAD software before physical construction. Each component—including the chassis, motor mounts, battery cover, sensor holders, and servo brackets—was individually designed to exact dimensions. These designs were then assembled virtually in SolidWorks to verify spatial alignment, mechanical fit, and wiring paths.
	
	This digital mockup allowed us to detect and resolve potential mechanical interferences before 3D printing. The rendered model accurately represents the real-world robot structure and showcases the integration of all electronic and mechanical parts into a compact and modular design.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item IR sensors → pins 2 and 3
		\item Ultrasonic → TRIG (12), ECHO (13)
		\item Servo → pin 9
		\item Motor driver → IN1-IN4: pins 5–8; ENA/ENB: pins 10–11
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Software Implementation}
	
	\subsection{A. UPPAAL Simulation}
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth, height=0.4\textheight, keepaspectratio]{uppaal_simulation.png}
		\caption{UPPAAL Timed Automata Model for Robot Control}
		\label{fig:uppaal}
	\end{figure}
	
	To formally verify the robot’s behavior, a timed automata model was created in UPPAAL. The simulation captures key control states such as line following, obstacle detection, and turning logic with time constraints. By modeling transitions and clock conditions, we validated the robot’s response timing to avoid delays or missed decisions during operation. This ensures reliability in real-world dynamic scenarios.
	
	
	\subsection{B. LTspice Simulation}
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth, height=0.4\textheight, keepaspectratio]{ltspice_simulation.png}
		\caption{LTspice Motor Driver Circuit Simulation}
		\label{fig:ltspice}
	\end{figure}
	
	The motor driver circuit was simulated in LTspice to ensure proper voltage levels, current flow, and switching behavior before hardware implementation. This simulation helped verify the performance of the L298N driver in handling bidirectional DC motor control, confirming safe operation under load and validating protective components such as flyback diodes.
