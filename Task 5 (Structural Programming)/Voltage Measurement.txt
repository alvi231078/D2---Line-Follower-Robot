Project: Line Following Robot  
Name:
Date: 01 June, 2025

---

## Tools Used
- Digital Multimeter: [Brand & Model, e.g., UNI-T UT33C+]
- Measurement Tolerance: ±0.01V
- Power Source: LiPo Battery (11.1V nominal, 12.6V full)

---

## Measurement Procedure

1. System powered on with full battery.
2. Measurements taken at key power distribution points:
   - VIN pin of Arduino
   - 5V output pin of Arduino
   - Motor driver VCC input
   - IR and ultrasonic sensor VCC pins

## Measurement Results

| Location                         | Expected Voltage | Measured Voltage |
|----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Battery Output (XT60 Connector) | 11.1 – 12.6 V    | 11.7 V           |
| Arduino VIN Pin                 | 11.1 – 12.6 V    | 11.68 V          |
| Arduino 5V Pin                  | 5.0 V            | 4.99 V           |
| Sensor VCC (IR, Ultrasonic)     | 5.0 V            | 5.00 V           |
| Motor Driver VCC                | 11.1 – 12.6 V    | 11.7 V           |

## Safety Check

- No major voltage drop observed.
- Sensors receive stable 5.0V from Arduino.
- Motor driver supplied directly from battery (works correctly).
- System construction (soldering) completed and inspected.

## Conclusion

✅ Power lines are stable and within expected range.  
✅ System is electrically safe and ready for operation.
