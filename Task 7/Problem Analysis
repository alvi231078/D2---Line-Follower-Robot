Several components in the system are affected by voltage levels, and their performance can degrade when power is low. The motors, which rely directly on voltage, show reduced speed and result in slower turning movements. The IR sensors are sometimes affectedâ€”under low power conditions, their detection reliability can drop, causing intermittent failures. The color sensor is also voltage-dependent; since its accuracy relies on the brightness of its built-in LED, any drop in voltage can reduce its ability to detect colors correctly. Finally, the ultrasonic sensor becomes less reliable when voltage drops, leading to inconsistent or inaccurate distance readings.
