The purpose of this task is to ensure that our robot behaves consistently and reliably under different battery levels.

Without adaptation:
	•	Motors slow down 
	•	Sensors behave erratically 
	•	Line following and obstacle avoidance degrade 
So, we implemented a voltage-aware optimization system that adjusts behavior in real time based on battery level.
