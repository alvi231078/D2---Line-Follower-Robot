Define Global Scope: 

const int VOLTAGE_PIN = A6;
const float MAX_VOLTAGE = 8.4;
const float MIN_VOLTAGE = 6.0;
float voltageRatio = 1.0;



Inside loop(), update ratio:


int rawVoltage = analogRead(VOLTAGE_PIN);
float measuredVoltage = (rawVoltage / 1023.0) * 5.0 * (15.0 / 5.0);  // based on resistor divider
voltageRatio = constrain((measuredVoltage - MIN_VOLTAGE) / (MAX_VOLTAGE - MIN_VOLTAGE), 0.5, 1.0);


Replacing Static Speeds with Scaled Ones: 


#define BASE_SPEED_RAW     80
#define TURN_SPEED_RAW     75
#define REVERSE_SPEED_RAW  65
#define SEARCH_SPEED_RAW   60

int BASE_SPEED    = BASE_SPEED_RAW * voltageRatio;
int TURN_SPEED    = TURN_SPEED_RAW * voltageRatio;
int REVERSE_SPEED = REVERSE_SPEED_RAW * voltageRatio;
int SEARCH_SPEED  = SEARCH_SPEED_RAW * voltageRatio;
